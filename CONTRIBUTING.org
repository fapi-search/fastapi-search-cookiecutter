** Local Dev Setup
Because this is a cookiecutter, that is, a template to generate a running site, but not a running site itself, it's a bit "meta" to work on many features. A typical practice to deal with this looks like
1. Fork the repo and clone locally
2. Create a cookiecutter built version of the service, e.g.,
  #+begin_src bash
    cookiecutter fastapi-search-cookiecutter
  #+end_src
3. Answer questions
  #+begin_src bash
    project_name [Search Project]: FastAPI Search Work
    project_slug [fastapi-search-work]: 
    default_host [0.0.0.0]: 
    default_port [8001]: 
    default_postgres_url [http://db_user:db_pass@localhost:5432/app_db]: 
    default_search_url [http://admin:admin@localhost:9200]: 
    Select search_backend:
    1 - opensearch
    2 - elasticsearch
    Choose from 1, 2 [1]: 1
  #+end_src
4. ~cd fastapi-search-work~
5. Code, test, and run your changes
6. Copy changed files back to the ~fastapi-search-cookiecutter~ repo, /taking care/ where files have cookiecutter logic in them.
7. Run cookiecutter on your updated repo
  #+begin_src bash
    cookiecutter fastapi-search-cookiecutter
  #+end_src
8. Answer questions for a new instance
  #+begin_src bash
    project_name [Search Project]: FastAPI Search Test
    project_slug [fastapi-search-test]: 
    default_host [0.0.0.0]: 
    default_port [8001]: 
    default_postgres_url [http://db_user:db_pass@localhost:5432/app_db]: 
    default_search_url [http://admin:admin@localhost:9200]: 
    Select search_backend:
    1 - opensearch
    2 - elasticsearch
    Choose from 1, 2 [1]: 1
  #+end_src
9. Make sure everything looks right, tests pass, etc. Running a tree diff between the work and test instances can be helpful.
** Process
Until CI and versioning is setup, our SDLC will be a bit ad-hoc. Assuming you're working on an [[https://github.com/fapi-search/fastapi-search-cookiecutter/issues][issue already in the repo]], submit a PR from your fork citing that issue. For those working directly on the upstream, use the issue create a branch link,
[[./img/create-a-branch-from-issue.png]]
which provides a reasonably slugified branch name...
[[./img/create-a-branch-for-this-issue.png]]
